\subsection{Representation theory of the function algebra on the dynamical quantum $SU(2)$ group}


% Study spectrum fundamental character
% Study dual quantum groupoid
% Make connection with dynamical cocycle
% In case of qgroupoid constructed from identity functor for Rep(SU_q(2)): rep theory of associated Galois object should just be: a single representation (Galois object is type I factor, cutdown of $B(\mathscr{L}^2(SU_q(2)))$). Yes: in general, Galois object is Morita equivalent with algebra of original ergodic action, should also be stressed for Podles spheres

\begin{Lem} There are faithful $^*$-representations $\pi_{\pm}$ of $\Pol_{\ext}(\X)$ as operators $\mathscr{D}^{\pm}\rightarrow \mathscr{D}^{\pm}$, given by the following formulas (where we suppress the explicit notations $\pi_{\pm}$): \begin{align*} \alpha\cdot e_{n,y}^+ = \left(\frac{1+q^{2n-2y}}{1+q^{-2y-2}}\right)^{1/2}e_{n,y+1}^+,&& \beta\cdot e_{n,y}^+ = \left(\frac{q^{-2y}-q^{2n-2y+2}}{1+q^{-2y-2}}\right)^{1/2}e_{n+1,y+1}^+,\end{align*}
\begin{align*} \alpha\cdot e_{n,y}^- = \left(\frac{1-q^{2n}}{1+q^{-2y-2}}\right)^{1/2}e_{n-1,y+1}^-,&& \beta\cdot e_{n,y}^- = \left(\frac{q^{2n+2}+q^{-2y}}{1+q^{-2y-2}}\right)^{1/2}e_{n,y+1}^-,\end{align*} the functions in $C_c(\R)$ simply acting by $fe_{n,y}^{\pm}= f(y)e_{n,y}^{\pm}$.

Both representations are bounded when restricted to $\Pol(\X)$.
\end{Lem}
