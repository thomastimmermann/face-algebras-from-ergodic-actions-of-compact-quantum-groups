\section{Introduction}

In the following, we follow the physicist's convention that inner products on Hilbert spaces are anti-linear in their \emph{first} argument. Whenever convenient, we will also identify $\mathscr{H}$ with $B(\C,\mathscr{H})$, so that we can write $\langle \xi,\eta\rangle = \xi^*\eta$.
